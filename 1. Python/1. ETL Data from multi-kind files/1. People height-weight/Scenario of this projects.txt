Scenario:
We need to extract files from diversity of files ranging from csv, json, xml on local environments.
This is to demonstrate my abilities to apply Python functions, Pandas and other modules that work with specific formats, such as xml.etree.ElementTree (XML)
Next, to transform into the designated column type and load to CSV then put into SQL Server.

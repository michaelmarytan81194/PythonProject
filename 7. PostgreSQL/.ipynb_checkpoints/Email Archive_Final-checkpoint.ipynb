      "> \n",

      "> research and tutorial groups tend to assemble and disperse).\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Users also seem, in practice, to react positively to the consistent\n",

      "> those who have more issues with the presentation of identity, may react\n",
      "> against the blandly repetitive styling and the attribution issues\n",
      "> raised. But the majority, as far as I can tell, react positively to\n",
      "> simple navigation around a single server  (rather than the >1000 we must\n",
      "> have here at the moment, each with their own tweaks and\n",
      "> ideosynchrosies). I realise that the navigation and branding issues are\n",
      "> distinct, but they're highly entwined.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Also, as more tools are added, the problem starts to escalate with an\n",
      "> assembly of interoperating tools (as O(n^2)), but remain linear (O(n))\n",
      "> with each tool which is added to an LMS framework (obviously this is a\n",

      "> \n",
      "> As the issues you raise concerning lock-in become apparent there are\n",

      "> \n",

       "'Yup, I think this is spot-on. Either/or, in reality, is actually neither\\nand both. We\\'ve had many discussions internally at SUNY about just how\\nloose our coupling can be. You start from either end and you work toward\\nthe middle. But as a teaching and learning person, as a person who is\\ngoing to live in this app every day, I feel a strong sense of personal\\nurgency to put the issue of the long tail of learning applications as a\\ncore design concern (which is why, by the way, that I think this\\ndiscussion belongs on the dev list and not the advocacy list). This is\\nnot an issue of making your LMS cooler or sexier or more interesting.\\nIt\\'s about making it more *useful*. Regardless of whether \"LMS\" or \"VLE\"\\nis your preferred term, there is an \"L\" in there somewhere. \\n\\nLook, I\\'m a teacher. I don\\'t care whether you guys decide to use flux\\ncapacitor or an oscillating overthruster. I just want a good environment\\nto teach in. And my perspective as a teacher is that this long tail\\nissue is really, really important. Any LMS design that doesn\\'t take it\\nvery seriously as a core design requirement, IMHO, is not really\\naddressing the \"L\" the way it needs to be addressed in next-generation\\nlearning environments.\\n\\nI would add that, from my perspective, this debate also isn\\'t really\\nabout Sakai vs. something else. SUNY has particular needs which favor a\\nparticular implementation strategy. That\\'s a relatively local concern of\\none institution. In the biggest picture, SUNY doesn\\'t matter that much.\\nNeither does Sakai. What matters is that the global community is in the\\nmidst of thinking through next-generation learning environment design.\\nAs John points out, we agree on a lot.

What I\\n> really mean (I think) is that at a research-led University, much of our\\n> teaching in terms of styles of interaction, is derivative of, or based\\n> upon, how research is performed, rather than teaching as it might be\\n> seen as an adaptation of school teaching to a different demographic.\\n> \\n> I know that sounds vague, but things like group size, formality of\\n> \"courses\", open access to learning resources, the degree of direction\\n> and self-motivation, and so on, have real practical implications on any\\n> system we might deliver to campus.\\n> \\n> A collegiate University also has incredibly complex reporting and\\n> responsibility structure, which impacts on any top-down type approach.\\n> Essentially, nobody has the whole picture of a researcher or student\\'s\\n> learning experience other than that person themselves. That\\'s part of\\n> the reason, I think, that we\\'re after a system which focuses on the\\n> individual first, then their researching role, and then their teaching\\n> role, and allowing people to exchange their various roles in different\\n> contexts with ease.\\n> \\n> It\\'s these concerns which are the outstanding pressures, as I see it, in\\n> choosing a learning system. I think that many of these issues are\\n> reflected in Oxford University\\'s report on the choice of Bodington\\n> (fine-grained access control, no course registration, etc).\\n> \\n> The real \\'selling\\' point of Sakai, as I see it, at the moment as a tool\\n> is its community and adopters, rather than its codebase. And a large\\n> number of research-led (comparatively) resource-rich Universities are\\n> adopting it, some completely committed to it at least in the\\n> medium-term, and so we can be reasonably sure that where needs of\\n> research-led Universities are not met by Sakai, then they will be\\n> forthwith, and Sakai won\\'t move in a direction incompatible with this\\n> use (not that this will be its exclusive use!).\\n> \\n> Also, it currently does the job tolerably well: group management can be\\n> easily delegated, it accomodates small informal teaching groups,\\n> navigation between many fragmented informal components\\n> \\n> This is why, I think, we have interests in, for example, the JISC VRE\\n> Sakai work.\\n> \\n> We\\'ve spoken a lot recently here, internally, about approaches to\\n> providing resources along those lines, and the SUNY LMOS model\\n> (mentioned by name!) was the other leading contender.\\n> \\n> I don\\'t disagree with any of the downsides to using an integrated LMS\\n> that Patrick raised. Core tools are often behind the state-of-the-art,\\n> and need to be integrated into a VLE. It could be argued that a set of\\n> enterprise-type services (single-sign-on auth, LDAP, common navigation\\n> \\'frame\\', etc) can be used to support a set of tools.\\n> \\n> Part of the problem we find, though, is that many of the enterprise\\n> tools are not suited to an environment like this (it\\'s difficult, for\\n> example, for LDAP, to capture the creative anarchy of the way many\\n> research and tutorial groups tend to assemble and disperse).\\n> \\n> Users also seem, in practice, to react positively to the consistent\\n> navigation and style provided by these tools. The more vociferous users,\\n> those who have more issues with the presentation of identity, may react\\n> against the blandly repetitive styling and the attribution issues\\n> raised. But the majority, as far as I can tell, react positively to\\n> simple navigation around a single server  (rather than the >1000 we must\\n> have here at the moment, each with their own tweaks and\\n> ideosynchrosies). I realise that the navigation and branding issues are\\n> distinct, but they\\'re highly entwined.\\n> \\n> Also, as more tools are added, the problem starts to escalate with an\\n> assembly of interoperating tools (as O(n^2)), but remain linear (O(n))\\n> with each tool which is added to an LMS framework (obviously this is a\\n> simplification). Also, it becomes simple to develop \"mix-and-match\"\\n> tools from services already in the framework because of their\\n> comonalities.\\n> \\n> As the issues you raise concerning lock-in become apparent there are\\n> starting to be standards developed which allow \"external\" applications,\\n> like IMS launch, though they\\'re currently a little immature.\\n> \\n> Another advantage to a deployer at the moment, of course, is that Sakai\\n> exists!
